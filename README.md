# Leaflet-Challenge
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge,we have to develop a way using Leaflet library to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
We have to create a map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Additionally, include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. Also, creating a legend that will provide context for the map data is part of the task.
